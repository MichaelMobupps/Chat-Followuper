# Godlike Audit — Running Log & Checkpoint

**Purpose:** Durable record so nothing is lost on SSH disconnect. This file + the
git commits on branch `audit/godlike-fixes` together are a full resumable checkpoint.

Rubric: `debug-special-cases-prompt-v2.md` (Godlike Standard v2), adapted to a
multi-package codebase, plus **blast-radius** per finding and **auto-fix** (user
chose: auto-fix everything, on a branch).

---

## Session state

- **Branch:** `audit/godlike-fixes` (main untouched at `e9ed33c`)
- **Snapshot commit:** `0d8714f` — "checkpoint: WIP snapshot before godlike audit (97 files)"
  - This preserves the user's 97 uncommitted WIP files. `git checkout main` discards all audit work.
- **Git identity set (repo-local):** hwholestorm@gmail.com

## Baseline health probe (before any fixes)

- `pnpm run typecheck` → **PASS (exit 0)** across all packages. This is the regression bar: no NEW typecheck errors.
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run test` → **FAIL (exit 1)** — pre-existing.
  - Cause: `column "pushover_user_key" of relation "users" does not exist`.
  - Diagnosis: ORM schema (`lib/db/src/schema/users.ts`) declares a `pushover_user_key`
    column that was never migrated/pushed to the live dev DB. **Schema/migration drift.**
  - Recorded as **FINDING #1** (pending DB-agent confirmation of whether a migration file exists).

## Method

Phases 1-6 executed as 8 parallel READ-ONLY subsystem auditors (Agent tool fan-out),
each applying triple-framing (Technical / Security / End-user) and returning
findings with severity + blast radius + concrete fix + fix-confidence. Then:
consolidate → triage → auto-fix serially with typecheck health probe after each batch.

### Auditors launched
1. API routes, middleware, app wiring, session/admin/token libs
2. Anthropic / message generation (LLM, retry, pricing, prompts)
3. Apollo / discovery (prospector, orgFinder, webhook security, geo gate)
4. Followups / scheduling / notifications (schedulers, mailer, pushover)
5. Channels & templating (whatsapp/telegram/teams/slack deep links)
6. DB (schema, migrations, actionLog helpers, seed)
7. Dashboard frontend (pages, hooks, api client, UX)
8. Build / config / tooling / hygiene / secrets

## Findings ledger

- **F1** [High] Schema/migration drift: `users.pushover_user_key` in ORM schema but not in live DB. (source: baseline db test)

*(auditor findings appended below as they return)*

## Fix log

*(each applied fix recorded here: finding id, files, health-probe result)*

---

## Checkpoint / next action

Auditors running. Next: consolidate returned findings into the ledger, triage, begin auto-fix.
